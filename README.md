Course 5: Data Analysis and Visualization with Power BI
Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate

üß≠ Executive Summary (STAR Method)
S ‚Äî Situation
Adventure Works executives urgently needed a strategic-level Power BI dashboard to consolidate fragmented data from sales, product inventory,
and customer segments. Their goal was to uncover meaningful insights to support high-stakes decisions around performance, market expansion, and inventory efficiency.

T ‚Äî Task
I was responsible for creating a comprehensive, interactive Power BI report that:
Visualized performance metrics using key visuals
Included forecasting for future planning
Allowed natural Q&A interaction for self-service insights

A ‚Äî Action
To meet the executive team's requirements, I:
Built a table to show product pipeline and order status
Created a clustered column chart to compare product category sales
Designed a line chart with forecasting to track seasonal trends
Developed KPI cards for quick checks on revenue, customer count, and city distribution
Integrated the Q&A visual to allow natural language queries
Used tooltips and styling to enhance usability and clarity

R ‚Äî Result
The final report enabled stakeholders to:
Identify top-selling and underperforming product categories
Understand customer reach and sales trends by city
Forecast Q2 performance with 99% confidence
Ask direct questions and get immediate answers with the Q&A visual
‚Üí This project successfully translated raw data into business-critical insights and demonstrated my ability to communicate clearly through data storytelling.
